Collects and stores loan information through Lending Club API over time.

Peer to peer loans is a billion dollar industry and an alternative investment opportunity. The objective as a p2p loans investor is deceptively simple: yield a high return while mitigating risk. The feedback while investing is quite marginal-- you spread your risk among a broad spectrum of loans in the form of $25 notes, and wait with fingers crossed that the debt is not defaulted on. As a p2p investor, it is difficult to adapt when the wedge of information is so narrow as to what constitutes a good investment. Lending Club does provide an API in which many are encouraged to conduct automating the purchasing of loans. As a billion dollar industry, one of the most common complaints is that the "good" loans are snatched up quickly. With this in mind, this application "Lending Club Commons" aims to provide a means of mining the 'popularity' of loans, by storing snapshots of all available loans over time. There is a wealth of variables that could be associated with the "quality" of a loan, such as length of employment or revolving credit. Their value could be mapped against how quickly loans are satisfied over time (one that is consumed over hours would be much prefered over one over 14 days).
